# Thanks!

We hope you've had a great time today and learned something useful!

We couldn't have put this together without the help of our volunteers,
the venue and food from SEEK, and the Alt .Net Meetup group for inviting everyone
along too!

Thanks a lot for coming along today and if you've developed a taste for Haskell
then please consider coming along to the
[Melbourne Haskell User's Group Meetup.](https://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-Haskell-Users-Group/)

MHUG runs monthly at [Silverpond](http://silverpond.com.au/) a machine-learning consultancy who
not-coincidentally also [run workshops](http://silverpond.com.au/workshops).
